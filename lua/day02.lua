The engineers are trying to figure out which reports are safe. The Red-Nosed reactor safety systems can only tolerate levels that are either gradually increasing or gradually decreasing. So, a report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

    The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
    Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.

-- Use curly braces to create a table literal
local reports = {}

-- Read lines, stolen from day 1
-- Alternative option spelling out its a global
-- for line in _G.io.lines() do
for line in io.lines() do
    -- something
end


-- The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.


-- Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
